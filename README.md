# World Population Demographics by Age 2019 - Data Analysis and Visualization

This project analyzes the **World Population Demographics by Age (2019)** dataset using Python. We explore the age distribution across various countries and visualize the data using histograms and bar charts.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the world population distribution by age and create visualizations to better understand demographic trends. We clean the data, handle missing values, and visualize the distribution of ages across different countries, as well as make country comparisons.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Kaggle API
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/world-population-demographics
   cd world-population-demographics
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your Kaggle API credentials:
   - Download your `kaggle.json` file from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/account).
   - Upload your `kaggle.json` file to your environment:
     ```bash
     mkdir ~/.kaggle
     cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
     chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
     ```

4. Download the dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API:
   ```bash
   kaggle datasets download -d lachmann12/world-population-demographics-by-age-2019
   ```

5. Unzip the dataset:
   ```bash
   unzip world-population-demographics-by-age-2019.zip
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on the population demographics by age for various countries in 2019. You can download the dataset directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lachmann12/world-population-demographics-by-age-2019).

### Columns:

- `Country or Area`: The country or area of the population data
- `Year`: The year of the record (2018 in this case)
- `Area`: Geographic region
- `Sex`: Gender (Male, Female, Both Sexes)
- `Age`: Age of individuals
- `Record Type`: Type of record
- `Reliability`: Reliability of the data
- `Source Year`: Year when the data source was recorded
- `Value`: Population size
- `Value Footnotes`: Additional notes regarding the data

## Data Cleaning

We handle missing values, check for duplicates, and convert necessary columns to numeric types. The dataset is cleaned before being used for analysis.

### Steps for Data Cleaning:

1. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv('world_population_by_age_2019.csv')
   ```

2. Check for missing values:
   ```python
   df.isnull().sum()
   ```

3. Handle missing values if necessary:
   ```python
   df.fillna(0, inplace=True)
   ```

4. Convert columns to numeric types where necessary:
   ```python
   df['Value'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Value'], errors='coerce')
   ```

## Visualizations

The following visualizations are created in this project:

1. **Overall Age Distribution**: A histogram showing the distribution of ages in the world population.
2. **Age Distribution Comparison**: A comparison of the age distributions between different countries using histograms and bar charts.

### Steps for Visualization:

1. Set up the environment for plotting:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns
   sns.set(style="whitegrid")
   ```

2. Create a histogram to visualize the age distribution:
   ```python
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   sns.histplot(df['Age'], bins=30, kde=True)
   plt.title('Age Distribution in World Population (2019)')
   plt.xlabel('Age')
   plt.ylabel('Frequency')
   plt.grid()
   plt.show()
   ```

3. Create a bar chart to compare age distribution by country:
   ```python
   plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
   sns.barplot(x='Country or Area', y='Value', data=df[df['Age'] == 30])
   plt.title('Population by Country for Age 30')
   plt.xlabel('Country or Area')
   plt.ylabel('Population')
   plt.xticks(rotation=90)
   plt.show()
   ```

## Usage

Once the dataset is downloaded and cleaned, you can explore various visualizations by running the provided Jupyter notebooks.

### Steps to Use the Jupyter Notebook:

1. Start the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the notebook and run the cells to perform the analysis.
